# Full-page caching

## Enabling the Cache lookup

This is only enabled for GET requests.
Any POST requests or alike will not be cached as per HTTP specs.

### Middleware
In your `/src/Application.php` add the Cache middleware right after the the assets one for example:
```php
/**
 * @param \Cake\Http\MiddlewareQueue $middlewareQueue The middleware queue to setup.
 * @return \Cake\Http\MiddlewareQueue The updated middleware.
 */
public function middleware(MiddlewareQueue $middlewareQueue): MiddlewareQueue {
    $middlewareQueue
        ...
        ->add(new AssetMiddleware())

        // Handle cached files
        ->add(new CacheMiddleware([
            'when' => function (ServerRequest $request, Response $response) {
                // Implement
            },
            'keyGenerator' => function ($key, $prefix) {
                // Implement
            },
        ]))

        ...

    return $middlewareQueue;
}
```

It by default only gets invoked for GET requests, as per HTTP spec for caching (POST requests should never be cached).
If you need to further specify it, see then `'when'` config and pass a callable to the component and the middleware.

## Usage
Once the Middleware is loaded, you need to add the component to the controllers you want to make cache-able:
```php
/**
 * @return void
 */
public function initialize(): void {
    $this->loadComponent('Cache.Cache', [
        'actions' => [
            ...
        ],
        ...
    ]);
}
```

The component creates the cache file, the dispatcher on the next request will discover it and deliver this static file instead as long
as the file modification date is within the allowed range.
Once the file gets too old it will be cleaned out, a real action will be called and a fresh cache file will be created.

```php
    $this->loadComponent('Cache.Cache', [
        'when' => function (ServerRequest $request) {
             return !$request->is('ajax');
        },
    ]);
}
```
In this case we also exlude AJAX requests.


### Global Configuration

#### File only
The `CACHE` constant can be adjusted in your bootstrap and defaults to `tmp/cache/views/`.

If you need a prefix in order to allow multiple (sub)domains to deliver content in multiple languages for example, use
 `Configure::write('CacheConfig.prefix', 'myprefix')` to separate them.

#### Engine based
Here you can just configure your preferred cache engine as `app.php` piece, e.g.:
```php
    'default' => [
        'className' => 'File',
        'path' => CACHE,
        'prefix' => 'myprefix_',
    ],
```

### Component Configuration
If you only want certain actions to be cached, provide them as `actions` array.
The default `cacheTime` can be set as global value, but if you want certain actions to be cached differently, use the `actions` array:
```php
'actions' => ['report', 'view' => DAY, 'index' => HOUR],
```

In case you want to further compress the output, you can either use the basic built in compressor:
```php
'compress' => true,
```
or you can use any custom compressor using a callable:
```php
'compress' => function ($content, $ext) { ... },
```
The latter is useful if you want to control the compression per extension.

With debug mode being on the cache is by default not enabled. You can force this locally using this param:
```php
'force' => true,
```

Note: If you use engine based caching, the duration (if used) cannot exceed the engine defined frame.
So you can only shorten some durations, never make them longer.

#### Custom keys
Depending on the engine you use, you might have the need to create custom cache keys.
You can use any custom generator using a callable:
```php
'keyGenerator' => function ($url, $prefix) { ... },
```
For file based storage for example, it can make sense to nest your files in subfolders.
This way you can retrieve them faster for many files stored and also don't run into
max file per folder limitation.

### Clear the Cache
The Cache shell shipped with this plugin should make it easy to clear the cache manually:
```
cake page_cache clear [/optional/url]
```

#### Further Cache Shell Goodies
Using
```
cake page_cache status [/optional/url]
```
you get the amount of currently cached files.

Using
```
cake page_cache status /some-controller/some-action?maybe=query-strings
```
You can get information on the cache status of this particular URL, e.g.
- when the cache for it was created.
- how long it is still cached.

### Debugging
In debug mode or with config `debug` enabled, you will see a timestamp added as comment to the beginning of the cache file.

## Limitations
- It cannot provide partially dynamic parts as the 2.x CacheHelper could. The pages need to be completely cached.
So this is most likely a useful caching strategy for static full-page HTML or non-HTML requests like JSON, XML, CSV, ...
- Make sure you only cache public and non-personalized actions.
The dispatcher cannot know if cache files of some non-public actions are requested by an authorized user.

## TODOS
- Limit filename length to around 200 (as it includes query strings) and add md5 hashsum instead as suffix.
- Extract the common file name part into a trait for both component and filter to use.
- Allow usage of subfolders for File cache to avoid the folder to have millions of files as a flat list?
- What happens with custom headers set in the original request? How can we pass those to the final cached response?
- Re-implement the removed CacheHelper with its nocache parts?
